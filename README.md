# Hackathena Bundles

Hackathons involve multiple challenges, from judging to communication, and from verification to mentorship. We built **BUNDLES** as an all-in-one solution to make everything more efficient, accessible, and automated. **BUNDLES** is a complete software suite that powers Hackathena 25. It includes multiple tools that help organizers, judges, and participants have a smooth and well-coordinated experience."

 - A dedicated website for event management
 - A judge evaluation system for fair scoring
 - A participants app for seamless coordination
 - A verification system for security
 - Telegram bots for instant updates and mentor access

# About our apps

You can try using all apps just folder by folder.
Requires PNPM for js files and pip install for python library installation

## Official Website

We have an official website where all the registration and details of the hackathon are included. I believe that you all have visited this website during registration

## Participants App

"The Participants App is designed to help teams stay connected throughout the event. It includes: 
• Live notifications on event updates 
• Workspace for saving important things 
• Profile shows everything about you 
• A stall to get anything fast on your table 
This app ensures that no participant misses important details!"

## Verification App

"Security is crucial at any hackathon. The Verification App helps organizers confirm participant identities before granting access to event resources. It ensures that only registered hackers can participate."

## Announcement Bot

"Hackathon schedules and updates change frequently. Instead of relying on emails, we created a Telegram Announcement Bot that instantly notifies all participants about:
- Schedule updates 
- Important announcements 
- Submission deadlines 
This keeps everyone informed in real time."

## Shop & Mentor Bot

"Participants often need refreshments or mentorship during the hackathon. The Shop & Mentor Bot on Telegram allows core team to: 
• Get Request of hackathon resources (like additional API keys or hardware) 
• Notify Call for mentor support directly 
This ensures that participants get the help they need without delays."
